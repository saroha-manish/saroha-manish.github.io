            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Ensuring products are delivered on the exact promised date is a significant challenge, with delays or early deliveries
                impacting customer satisfaction. Factors like traffic, weather, and unforeseen disruptions often affect delivery schedules. 
                A reliable, data-driven solution is needed to predict precise delivery dates and adjust them dynamically in real time.
                This would improve service reliability and enhance customer experience.</p>

            <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
            <p>
To address the challenge of delivering products on the exact promised date, we developed a data-driven predictive system using historical delivery data, 
                product attributes, and logistics information. A machine learning model, primarily based on XGBoost, was trained to accurately estimate delivery duration at 
                the time of order placement. Key features included product category, customer region, warehouse handling time, and calendar-based factors like weekends and holidays.
                The predicted duration was used to assign a precise delivery date, improving on-time performance.
                Continuous monitoring and periodic retraining ensured the system remained effective and aligned with operational changes..</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>95% On-Time Deliveries</strong> Achieved 95% on-time deliveries by accurately forecasting delivery dates and dynamically adjusting schedules.</li>
                <li><strong>20% Reduction in Delivery Delays:</strong> Reduced delivery delays by 20% through real-time data integration and predictive adjustments to schedules.</li>
              <li><strong>30% Increase in Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Increased customer satisfaction by 30% due to improved delivery reliability and transparent communication with real-time updates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>A key challenge was managing and integrating real-time data from various sources, such as traffic and weather, to dynamically 
                adjust delivery schedules. Ensuring the system could handle unpredictable variables like road closures or severe weather disruptions 
                required robust data processing and continuous model updates. Additionally, maintaining the accuracy of delivery predictions while scaling
                the system for large volumes of deliveries was complex.
                Balancing customer expectations with real-time adjustments also posed challenges in communication and transparency.</p>

            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p> Implementing algorithms to dynamically prioritize deliveries based on urgency, customer importance, or 
                time-sensitive products, optimizing the use of available resources.</p>
