        <h1>Customer Churn Prediction</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>At HSC, developed a predictive system to identify customers at high risk of churn, 
                addressing a critical revenue-impacting issue. Leveraged machine learning models (Decision Trees, Random Forest, 
                Logistic Regression) to detect churn with 88% accuracy. The solution enabled targeted retention strategies, 
                leading to a 17% boost in customer retention and improved campaign effectiveness.</p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Rising customer churn was directly impacting business revenue and long-term customer value. 
                The organization lacked a data-driven system to identify at-risk customers early and implement timely,
                personalized retention strategies, resulting in missed opportunities to prevent attrition.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
            <p>Processed over 1 million customer records and 200,000 complaints to uncover top churn drivers. Built and optimized ML models (Decision Trees, Random Forest,
                Logistic Regression) with 88% prediction accuracy. 
                Integrated churn predictions into dashboards, providing actionable insights to marketing and business teams. 
                Enabled timely, targeted loyalty campaigns to retain high-risk customers.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Key challenges included dealing with imbalanced datasets where churned customers were a small fraction of the total, 
                making accurate predictions difficult. Extracting meaningful insights from unstructured complaint data required intensive preprocessing.
                Ensuring business teams understood and trusted model outputs was also critical. 
                These challenges were addressed through careful model tuning, explainable outputs, and stakeholder collaboration.
