        <h1>C5i Project - Inventory Management Optimization</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The C5i project focuses on optimizing inventory management and preventing stockouts by leveraging predictive modeling and time-series forecasting techniques. The goal was to build a system capable of forecasting stock levels based on historical data, external factors, and real-time data streams. The solution improved inventory accuracy by 30%, reducing stockouts by 25% and enhancing overall supply chain operations.</p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Traditional inventory management systems often fail to predict stock levels accurately, leading to frequent stockouts. This disrupts supply chains, increases operational costs, and negatively impacts customer satisfaction. The C5i project aimed to solve this problem by developing a predictive model to optimize inventory management.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
            <p>Collected and preprocessed historical inventory data, sales data, and external factors like weather and promotions. Built a time-series forecasting model using TensorFlow to predict future stock levels. Designed a system to integrate real-time data from various sources (weather, promotions, and demand forecasts) to continuously adjust predictions. The system was deployed using Docker for easy scalability and integration with existing inventory management systems.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>30% improvement</strong> in forecasting accuracy, leading to better stock level predictions.</li>
                <li><strong>25% reduction</strong> in stockouts, which increased operational efficiency and reduced inventory costs.</li>
                <li>Real-time adjustments allowed for better decision-making, reducing overstocking and stockouts.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Handling missing or noisy data required the implementation of advanced data preprocessing techniques. Integrating multiple data streams in real time required robust pipeline architecture, solved using Docker for deployment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>Expand the model to include real-time inventory tracking for even more accurate predictions. Integrate with ERP and supply chain management systems for seamless automation and decision-making.</p>
