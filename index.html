    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <p><strong>C5I</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Addressed late deliveries and visibility gaps by building machine learning models (XGBoost, LSTM) trained on historical delivery, weather, and traffic data.</li>
      <li>Achieved 92% delivery prediction accuracy and reduced delays by 15%.</li>
      <li>Enhanced delivery time estimations by integrating real-time weather, traffic, and carrier data, improving on-time delivery rates by 18%.</li>
      <li>Created Power BI/Tableau dashboards for real-time order tracking and issue detection, enabling faster resolution and improved stakeholder visibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Landis + Gyr</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built a predictive system to monitor network quality using MOS estimation, addressing poor visibility into user experience.</li>
      <li>Achieved 94% accuracy with machine learning models, optimizing Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM for robustness.</li>
      <li>Integrated MOS predictions into real-time dashboards for proactive issue tracking and resolution.</li>
      <li>Reduced customer complaints by 22% and improved SLA adherence through early detection of service degradation.</li>
    </ul>
