  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <p><strong>C5I</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identified major visibility gaps and frequent late deliveries in the logistics chain, leading to operational inefficiencies and stakeholder dissatisfaction.</li>
    <li>Tasked with building a data-driven solution to improve delivery prediction accuracy and optimize logistics performance.</li>
    <li>Engineered machine learning models (XGBoost, LSTM) using over 3 years of historical delivery, weather, and traffic data to capture delay patterns.</li>
    <li>Trained and validated models using hyperparameter tuning and time-series cross-validation to ensure generalization across regions and seasons.</li>
    <li>Achieved 92% delivery prediction accuracy, directly contributing to a 15% reduction in delayed shipments within the first quarter of deployment.</li>
    <li>Integrated real-time APIs for weather, traffic, and carrier data, refining dynamic ETA predictions and improving on-time delivery rates by 18%.</li>
    <li>Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau for real-time tracking, enabling operations teams to monitor order progress and proactively resolve delivery issues.</li>
    <li>Improved stakeholder visibility across supply chain operations and accelerated decision-making using alert-based visual analytics and historical trend views.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Landis + Gyr</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Faced with poor visibility into network quality and rising user complaints, the organization needed a predictive system to assess user experience.</li>
    <li>Assigned to design a machine learning solution that could estimate Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) in real-time to evaluate perceived audio quality.</li>
    <li>Collected and preprocessed vast network data including jitter, latency, packet loss, and bandwidth parameters for supervised learning models.</li>
    <li>Built and evaluated models using Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM; selected the optimal approach based on accuracy, speed, and robustness under changing conditions.</li>
    <li>Achieved 94% model accuracy in predicting MOS, significantly improving the accuracy of network quality estimations used by NOC teams.</li>
    <li>Integrated the model into a real-time monitoring system, pushing predictions into a centralized dashboard used by engineers and customer service reps.</li>
    <li>Enabled proactive identification and resolution of potential network degradations before user impact, shifting the organization from reactive to predictive operations.</li>
    <li>Reduced customer complaints by 22% and improved SLA compliance by enabling faster resolution of service disruptions and anomalies.</li>
  </ul>
