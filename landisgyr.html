        <h1>MOS PREDICTION</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Developed a predictive system at Landis+Gyr to estimate Quality of Experience (QoE) before user calls
                using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction. Leveraged machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) to 
                achieve 94% accuracy, enabling proactive network adjustments. This approach reduced customer complaints by 22% and
                improved SLA compliance through early detection of potential service issues.</p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Limited visibility into network performance and delayed detection of quality issues were leading to poor user experience and 
                increased customer complaints. There was a critical need for a proactive system that could predict the Quality of Experience (QoE), 
                specifically the Mean Opinion Score (MOS),
                before user interactions occurred, enabling timely network adjustments and improving overall service reliability.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
            <p>Collected and processed historical network and QoE data to extract key features impacting call quality.
Trained and optimized ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) to predict MOS with 94% accuracy.
Integrated the model into monitoring workflows to estimate MOS before user calls.
Enabled proactive network adjustments, reducing service issues and improving SLA compliance.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Challenges included limited high-quality data for accurate MOS prediction and the complexity of multiple network factors
                impacting QoE. Ensuring model robustness across varying conditions and integrating predictions into existing systems posed technical 
                hurdles. Gaining stakeholder confidence
                in a proactive system was also a key challenge. These factors required careful data processing and model optimization to overcome.
