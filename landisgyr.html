        <h1>C5i Project - Inventory Management Optimization</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The landis project focuses on optimizing inventory management and preventing stockouts by leveraging predictive modeling and time-series forecasting techniques. The goal was to build a system capable of forecasting stock levels based on historical data, external factors, and real-time data streams. The solution improved inventory accuracy by 30%, reducing stockouts by 25% and enhancing overall supply chain operations.</p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Network service providers often struggle with limited visibility into real-time user experience and delayed detection of service degradation, leading to increased customer complaints and poor SLA adherence. There is a need for a predictive system that can accurately estimate the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) to proactively monitor Quality of Experience (QoE) and enable timely network issue resolution..</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
            <p>torical network performance data, user interaction logs, and external factors affecting QoE, such as traffic load and latency. Built regression and deep learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) to predict MOS with high accuracy. Designed a system to integrate real-time network metrics for continuous monitoring and early issue detection. Deployed the solution using Docker for scalable integration with existing network management systems.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Achieved <strong>94% accuracy</strong> in predicting Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for network quality assessment.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced customer complaints by 22% </strong> through early detection of service degradation.</li>
                <li>Improved SLA adherence and overall user satisfaction with real-time QoE monitoring.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Handling incomplete and noisy network data was a significant challenge, necessitating the use of advanced preprocessing techniques and feature engineering to ensure model reliability. Maintaining high prediction accuracy in real time required continuous model tuning and validation to adapt to dynamic network conditions. Additionally, integrating the predictive system into existing operational dashboards called for a scalable and robust architecture, which was achieved through Docker-based deployment for seamless real-time monitoring.

            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>Enhance the model by incorporating additional real-time network metrics and user feedback for more precise MOS predictions.
Integrate the system with broader network management and incident response platforms to enable fully automated QoE-driven decision-making and remediation.</p>
