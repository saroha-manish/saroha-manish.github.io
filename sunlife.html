      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project converts early agent activity data into actionable performance insights.
        Using the first <strong>three months of agent performance</strong>, we predict whether a rookie
        agent is likely to become a <strong>High Performing Agent (AC ≥ 15,000 per month)</strong>.
        The system evaluates early sales momentum and provides probability scores to enable
        proactive coaching, structured onboarding, and better workforce planning decisions.

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        In insurance sales organizations, performance assessment often happens too late.
        Managers lack early signals to identify high-potential agents or intervene with
        underperforming ones. We needed a <strong>reliable early prediction system</strong> that uses
        initial performance data to identify future high performers and support data-driven
        coaching strategies.

      <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Agents were structured into <strong>quarterly tenure-based cohorts</strong>.
        For each agent, performance metrics from the first three months were captured and
        used to train classification models predicting high performance outcomes.
        Time-based validation ensured realistic performance measurement.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Monthly AC, AFYP, policies, and proposal counts.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Supervised classification with time-based validation.</li>
        <li><strong>Threshold Optimization:</strong> Balanced precision and recall for practical deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Risk scores surfaced to dashboards for managerial action.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong Predictive Performance:</strong> Maintained stable accuracy and ROC-AUC on unseen cohorts.</li>
        <li><strong>Early Differentiation:</strong> Successfully identified high-potential agents within 3 months.</li>
        <li><strong>Balanced Precision & Recall:</strong> Optimized for practical business deployment.</li>
      </ul>

        <em>Note:</em> Metrics may vary based on cohort composition and deployment environment.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Addressed class imbalance, ensured strict time-based validation to prevent data leakage,
        managed cohort alignment issues, and balanced model complexity with explainability for
        leadership stakeholders.
