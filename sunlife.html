    <h1>Advisor Tipping Point</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project helps the business <strong>identify promising new advisors early</strong> and
        <strong>support struggling advisors before they drop off</strong>.
        We use information from an advisor’s <strong>first 3 months</strong> to estimate whether they are
        likely to become a <strong>High Performing Advisor</strong> in <strong>months 4–6</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of it like an <strong>early warning + early opportunity system</strong>:
        it highlights who needs coaching, who needs encouragement, and where managers can take action.

      <h2>Business Objective</h2>
      <p>
        Predict future performance so we can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Improve early productivity:</strong> help advisors build strong momentum</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce early drop-offs:</strong> intervene before an advisor becomes inactive</li>
        <li><strong>Support managers:</strong> give clear, prioritized lists for coaching</li>
        <li><strong>Use resources smarter:</strong> focus efforts where impact is highest</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How This Helps the Business</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Coaching focus:</strong> managers know which advisors to help first</li>
        <li><strong>Better planning:</strong> branches can plan support and targets better</li>
        <li><strong>Early success tracking:</strong> measure whether interventions improve outcomes</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent decisioning:</strong> we can explain why someone is predicted high/low</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Data We Used</h2>
      <p>
        We used trusted business data already available in our systems, mainly from three areas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advisor Master:</strong> advisor code, contract start/end dates, status</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> business production signals (like AC/AFYP/policies)</li>
        <li><strong>Activity:</strong> proposal activity (online and offline)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="disclaimer">
        <em>Note:</em> The data is refreshed monthly and used for cohort-based evaluation (explained below).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Define “High Performing”</h2>
      <p>
        We used a clear business rule to define success:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High Performing Advisor (Target = 1):</strong> AC is <strong>15,000 or above</strong> in the target month</li>
        <li><strong>Others (Target = 0):</strong> AC is below 15,000 in the target month</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The model’s job is to estimate the chance of an advisor reaching this level in <strong>months 4–6</strong>,
        based on signals from <strong>months 1–3</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How the Prediction Works (Simple View)</h2>
      <p>
        We do not compare new advisors with senior advisors directly.
        Instead, we group advisors by “joining time” so comparisons are fair.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cohorts:</strong> advisors are grouped by quarter based on when they completed 3 months tenure</li>
        <li><strong>Input window:</strong> we look at performance/activity in <strong>months 1–3</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Prediction window:</strong> we estimate performance likelihood in <strong>months 4–6</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> everyone is evaluated at the same tenure stage</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who Is Included (Eligibility)</h2>
      <p>
        This model focuses only on the “rookie” window.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advisors must have completed <strong>at least 3 months</strong> tenure</li>
        <li>Advisors above <strong>4 months</strong> tenure are excluded (they are no longer in rookie stage)</li>
        <li>Advisors with invalid or missing key joining/contract details are excluded</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What the Output Looks Like</h2>
      <p>
        For each eligible advisor, the model gives a <strong>score between 0 and 1</strong>.
        This score represents the likelihood of becoming a high performer in months 4–6.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Score 0.82 = strong chance of becoming high performer</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Score 0.25 = needs attention/support early</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The output can be used to create simple business buckets:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High Potential:</strong> prioritize retention + growth support</li>
        <li><strong>Watchlist:</strong> coach on activity and conversion</li>
        <li><strong>At Risk:</strong> immediate intervention plan needed</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How to Use the Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Manager action list:</strong> top 20 advisors needing help, per branch</li>
        <li><strong>Coaching themes:</strong> low activity vs low conversion vs inconsistent production</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-up tracking:</strong> did coaching improve month 4 performance?</li>
        <li><strong>Branch review:</strong> compare branches on “early success rate”</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Drivers (What Matters Most)</h2>
      <p>
        The model typically learns from early momentum patterns. In simple terms, these factors matter most:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Month 2 and Month 3 production:</strong> strong momentum is a good sign</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> steady performance beats random spikes</li>
        <li><strong>Activity levels:</strong> regular proposals indicate pipeline building</li>
      </ul>

        <em>Note:</em> We can show simple “Top Reasons” views for business users using explainability charts.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data quality:</strong> missing or incorrect contract/joining dates in some records</li>
        <li><strong>Duplicates:</strong> repeated entries that needed removal</li>
        <li><strong>Behavior changes:</strong> advisor patterns can shift over time (policy/process changes)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Next Improvements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Add <strong>manager/branch influence</strong> signals to understand coaching impact</li>
        <li>Build <strong>monthly monitoring</strong> to detect shifts and keep predictions stable</li>
        <li>Include <strong>conversion quality</strong> (not just activity count)</li>
        <li>Create an <strong>intervention playbook</strong>: recommended actions by risk type</li>
      </ul>
