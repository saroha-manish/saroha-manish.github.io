    <h1>Agent Attrition Prediction Model</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Designed and implemented a production-ready <strong>Agent Attrition Prediction Model</strong>
        to identify early disengagement risk.
        The system analyzes tenure, performance momentum, and engagement signals to
        generate <strong>per-agent attrition risk scores</strong>, enabling proactive retention
        interventions and data-driven workforce planning.

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Attrition Risk Scoring:</strong> Generated probability scores with Low / Medium / High risk segmentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Early Tenure Monitoring:</strong> Focused on first 60–120 days, the most critical attrition window.</li>
        <li><strong>Reason Codes:</strong> Identified key drivers such as low productivity momentum and engagement gaps.</li>
        <li><strong>Cohort-Based Analysis:</strong> Tracked attrition trends across onboarding batches and branches.</li>
        <li><strong>Manager Activation:</strong> Delivered prioritized risk lists for structured follow-ups.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Early agent attrition significantly impacts revenue and onboarding investments.
        Managers lacked structured visibility into which agents were likely to disengage.
        A predictive and interpretable system was required to detect attrition risk early
        and enable timely coaching interventions.

      <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Built a supervised classification framework using tenure alignment,
        early performance indicators, and activity-based features.
        Implemented cohort-based validation to prevent data leakage and ensure stability.
        Converted model outputs into operational risk tiers and actionable reason codes
        for real-world deployment.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Tenure stage, productivity velocity, activity frequency.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Time-based cohort split for realistic performance evaluation.</li>
        <li><strong>Threshold Optimization:</strong> Balanced precision and recall for retention team capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Integrated scoring outputs into leadership dashboards.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early Risk Identification:</strong> Enabled detection of high-risk agents within the first few months.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Retention Prioritization:</strong> Focused manager effort on agents with highest attrition probability.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Adoption:</strong> Risk segmentation and reason codes improved leadership trust and usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Workforce Insight:</strong> Cohort-level analysis supported onboarding and staffing decisions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Differentiating temporary low momentum from genuine disengagement required
        careful feature design and validation. Cohort variability across regions and
        managers was addressed through stable modeling and continuous monitoring.
