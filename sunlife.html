    <h1>Agent Attrition Prediction & Retention Activation</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Designed and deployed a production-grade <strong>Agent Attrition Prediction Model</strong>
         to identify early disengagement risk.
        The system analyzes tenure, productivity momentum, and engagement signals to
        generate <strong>per-agent attrition probability scores</strong>, enabling proactive retention
        interventions and data-driven workforce planning.

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Attrition Risk Scoring:</strong> Generated probability scores with Low / Medium / High segmentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Early Tenure Monitoring:</strong> Focused on first 60–120 days, the highest attrition window.</li>
        <li><strong>Reason Codes:</strong> Identified key drivers such as low productivity velocity and engagement gaps.</li>
        <li><strong>Cohort-Based Analysis:</strong> Tracked attrition trends across onboarding batches and branches.</li>
        <li><strong>Manager Activation:</strong> Delivered prioritized high-risk lists for structured follow-ups.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Early agent attrition leads to significant revenue leakage and wasted onboarding investment.
        Managers lacked structured visibility into which agents were likely to disengage.
        A predictive and interpretable system was required to detect attrition risk early
        and enable timely coaching interventions.

      <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Built a supervised classification framework using tenure alignment,
        early productivity indicators, and activity-based features.
        Implemented cohort-based validation to prevent data leakage and ensure
        stable performance across onboarding batches.
        Model outputs were converted into operational risk tiers and actionable reason codes
        for real-world deployment.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Tenure stage, productivity velocity, activity frequency.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Time-based cohort split for realistic evaluation.</li>
        <li><strong>Threshold Optimization:</strong> Balanced precision and recall for retention team capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Integrated scoring outputs into leadership dashboards.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Model Performance:</strong> Achieved ROC-AUC of <strong>0.85+</strong> with stable validation across unseen cohorts.</li>
        <li><strong>Early Risk Detection:</strong> Identified ~70–75% of attrition cases within the first 3 months.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention Improvement:</strong> Contributed to a <strong>10–15% reduction</strong> in early agent attrition during pilot rollout.</li>
        <li><strong>Manager Efficiency:</strong> Reduced unstructured follow-ups by <strong>25%+</strong> through prioritized risk lists.</li>
        <li><strong>Workforce Planning:</strong> Enabled cohort-level attrition forecasting for strategic hiring adjustments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Differentiating temporary low performance from genuine disengagement required
        careful feature engineering and validation. Cohort and regional variability
        was addressed through stable modeling and periodic performance monitoring.
