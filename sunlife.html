    <h1>Advisor Tipping Point</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Advisor Tipping Point model helps the business identify, early in the journey, which new advisors are likely
        to become <strong>high performers in months 4–6</strong>. It uses signals from the advisor’s <strong>first 3 months</strong>
        (performance and activity) to generate a simple <strong>probability score</strong> for each eligible advisor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to support practical business decisions: prioritize coaching, improve early productivity, and reduce
        early drop-offs by acting before outcomes become irreversible.

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early warning + early opportunity:</strong> Highlights both at-risk and high-potential advisors.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple score output:</strong> Each eligible advisor receives a probability score (0–1).</li>
        <li><strong>Fair comparison:</strong> Uses tenure-based cohorts so rookies are compared with rookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Action-ready:</strong> Supports manager coaching lists and branch-level prioritization.</li>
        <li><strong>Explainable:</strong> Identifies top early drivers (momentum, consistency, activity).</li>
        <li><strong>Repeatable refresh:</strong> Designed for monthly scoring as new advisors join.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Technologies and Tools</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> Advisor master, performance and activity datasets (monthly refresh)</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> AWS S3 processed zone</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Python (pandas), SQL-style joins and aggregations</li>
        <li><strong>Modelling:</strong> Classification model producing probability scores</li>
        <li><strong>Explainability:</strong> Feature importance and optional SHAP-based explanation</li>
        <li><strong>Consumption:</strong> Output extracts for dashboards and business reporting</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Many advisors do not build strong momentum in the first few months, and by the time performance issues are visible
        in months 4–6, the opportunity to recover is often late. Managers also have limited time and need clarity on
        <strong>who to coach first</strong> and <strong>what kind of support is needed</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge is to use existing early signals (months 1–3) to predict likely outcomes (months 4–6) and enable
        timely intervention at scale.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
      <p>
        The model is built as a tenure-based scoring system that uses a fair cohort structure.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Define success:</strong> Set a clear business rule for “High Performing” in months 4–6 (e.g., AC threshold).</li>
        <li><strong>Build early signals:</strong> Summarize month 1–3 performance (AC/AFYP/policies) and activity (proposals).</li>
        <li><strong>Create cohorts:</strong> Group advisors by quarter based on completion of 3 months tenure.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare data:</strong> Remove duplicates, correct dates/types, and handle missing critical fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Train & validate:</strong> Train on earlier cohorts and validate on unseen cohorts to ensure stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Score advisors:</strong> Generate a probability score (0–1) for each eligible advisor.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable action:</strong> Convert scores into simple business buckets for coaching and intervention.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The model produces an easy-to-use scoring output that helps business teams take action early.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritized coaching:</strong> Managers get a ranked list of advisors who need attention first.</li>
        <li><strong>Support for high potential:</strong> Identify advisors with strong momentum for retention and growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Better resource allocation:</strong> Focus branch and manager time where impact is highest.</li>
        <li><strong>Business explainability:</strong> Drivers can be shared to build trust in decisions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="disclaimer">
        <em>Note:</em> Final evaluation metrics (AUC, lift, precision/recall) should be added after production validation.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data quality:</strong> Missing or inconsistent contract/joining dates for some advisors.</li>
        <li><strong>Duplicates:</strong> Repeated records requiring strict de-duplication rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Changing behavior:</strong> Shifts over time due to process/policy changes across cohorts.</li>
        <li><strong>Tenure alignment:</strong> Ensuring month 1–3 and month 4–6 windows are computed consistently.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intervention playbook:</strong> Recommended actions based on score and driver patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Manager/branch features:</strong> Capture coaching and branch effects to learn what support works.</li>
        <li><strong>Drift monitoring:</strong> Monthly checks to ensure the model remains stable over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality signals:</strong> Add conversion outcomes, not only activity counts.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Integrate outputs into dashboards and manager workflows for faster adoption.</li>
      </ul>
