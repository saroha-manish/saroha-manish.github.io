    <h1>Telemetry Failure Prediction & Proactive SR Automation</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project turns raw <strong>device telemetry</strong> into early warnings and
        clear actions. We model <em>trigger-symptom sequences</em> that typically precede
        incidents and predict whether they will culminate in a <strong>Service Request (SR)</strong>
        creation. The system continuously analyzes incoming signals, identifies risky
        symptom chains, and surfaces <strong>proactive recommendations</strong> so engineers can
        intervene before failure, reducing downtime and improving customer experience.

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sequence-Aware Detection:</strong> Learns patterns where <em>trigger symptoms</em> form a chain that commonly leads to SR creation.</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid Modeling:</strong> Uses <em>Hidden Markov Models (HMM)</em> to encode temporal state transitions and an <em>XGBoost</em> meta-classifier to score failure risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Proactive Alerts:</strong> Generates early warnings with recommended next actions (e.g., component check, firmware update, workload throttle).</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Integration:</strong> Publishes insights to dashboards (e.g., Power BI) and pushes notifications to on-call workflows.</li>
        <li><strong>Explainability:</strong> Highlights top symptoms, state transitions, and features contributing to risk scores.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalable Ingestion:</strong> Handles high-frequency telemetry from many devices with streaming-friendly preprocessing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        In complex systems, failures rarely appear as isolated events—they are preceded by
        <strong>symptom sequences</strong>. Without modeling the order and timing of these signals,
        teams react late, miss SLAs, and open SRs only after customer impact. We needed a
        solution that <em>understands temporal patterns</em> in telemetry, predicts likely SR
        creation ahead of time, and prescribes the most effective preventative action.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We build sequences from incoming telemetry and detect <em>trigger chains</em> using an
        <strong>HMM</strong> to map observed symptoms to hidden health states (Healthy → Degraded →
        Critical). The per-sequence state probabilities, dwell times, and transition
        statistics are then fed into an <strong>XGBoost</strong> meta-classifier to predict the
        probability of <strong>SR creation within a lead window</strong> (e.g., next 24–72 hours).
        The system outputs risk scores, top contributing symptoms, and <em>action playbooks</em>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sequence Construction:</strong> sliding windows, event bucketing, inter‑arrival gaps, and symptom n‑grams.</li>
        <li><strong>HMM Features:</strong> state posteriors, transition likelihoods, dwell times, and last state change recency.</li>
        <li><strong>Meta Features:</strong> recency counts, velocity/acceleration of KPIs, seasonality flags, device cohort stats.</li>
        <li><strong>Classifier Output:</strong> P(SR | sequence), lead time band, and mitigation suggestions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early Warnings:</strong> Identified high‑risk chains with meaningful lead time for intervention.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Reactive SRs:</strong> Fewer surprise SRs as teams acted on proactive alerts.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> Shorter triage cycles and clearer ownership via recommended actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Stakeholder Confidence:</strong> Transparent explanations (top symptoms/paths) built trust in the model.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="disclaimer"><em>Note:</em> Exact metrics (precision/recall, lead‑time lift) can be added for the target environment once validated.</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Key challenges included sparse/fragmented symptom logs, aligning clocks across sources,
        handling non-stationary behavior after firmware changes, and balancing early alerts
        with false positives. We iterated on sequence definitions, HMM state counts, class
        weights, and thresholding policies to optimize <em>lead time vs. accuracy</em> trade‑offs.

      <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Incorporate <strong>cost‑aware thresholds</strong> based on SLA penalties and service costs.</li>
        <li>Add <strong>online learning</strong> to adapt HMM and XGBoost to drift and new symptom codes.</li>
        <li>Extend to <strong>multivariate state‑space models</strong> and attention‑based sequence encoders.</li>
        <li>Tighten <strong>closed‑loop automation</strong>: auto‑open preventative tasks when risk exceeds policy.</li>
      </ul>
