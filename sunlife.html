    <h1>Agent Attrition Prediction Model</h1>

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project predicts <strong>future agent performance (Months 4–6)</strong> using
        insights from the first three months of activity. By analyzing early sales momentum,
        we classify agents into <strong>High Performing</strong> (AC ≥ 15,000) or <strong>Others</strong>,
        enabling proactive coaching, better onboarding support, and improved productivity outcomes.

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Insurance organizations often evaluate performance too late, limiting opportunities
        for early intervention. Without predictive signals, managers cannot prioritize coaching
        or identify high-potential agents quickly. The goal was to create a
        <strong>data-driven early forecasting system</strong> that improves productivity and retention
        through timely decision support.

      <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We structured the data into tenure-based cohorts and engineered performance
        features from the first three months. Multiple classification models were trained
        and evaluated using time-based splits to ensure realistic deployment conditions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Filtering, cleaning, and cohort alignment.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Monthly AC, AFYP, policies, and proposals.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Supervised classification with ROC-AUC evaluation.</li>
        <li><strong>Champion Selection:</strong> Selected model balancing accuracy, recall, and stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Probability scores surfaced for managerial action.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stable Validation Performance:</strong> Maintained strong ROC-AUC across unseen cohorts.</li>
        <li><strong>Balanced Precision & Recall:</strong> Effective identification of high-performing agents.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Early Differentiation:</strong> Clear separation between high-potential and low-momentum agents.</li>
      </ul>

        <em>Note:</em> Final metrics may vary depending on cohort mix and deployment conditions.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Managed class imbalance, prevented data leakage across cohorts, ensured
        stable time-based validation, and balanced model complexity with interpretability
        for leadership stakeholders.
